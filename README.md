# Self isolation watch
'Self isolation watch' is designed to help people keep track of their symptoms and see what other users' symptoms are. They can add a symptom, description and the date they started feeling this way. 
This will help them keep note of their potential retraction of the virus as well as give them an indication into how contagious they are. Users will be able to create a profile, where they save their symptoms, update them accordingly and when they are no longer symptomatic, they can delete them.' 

## Main Aims 
- To create an app that gives people a platform to share their symtpoms and learn about each others.
- Take the pressure of a person to remember when they started feeling this way. 

## User Stories 
 
- 'As a recent self isolater, I want to keep track of what symtpoms I have and how long I have had them, so that I have more information to give to the doctor.'

- 'As a key worker, I want to browse through patients' symptoms, so that I can speed up diagnosis. '

- 'As a recent self isolater, I want to update the symptoms I have had, so that I can find out how far from recovery I am.'

- 'As a recent self isolater, I want to read through other peoples symptoms and compare, so that I can find out if my symptoms are typical.'


## Personnas 
- 'Someone at work has recently tested positive for covid-19, we must self isolate and track our symtoms (if any), I spend all day on my laptop, if only there was an app where i could record my symptoms and the date i started feeling the symptoms too!' (Evelyn, 31, mother of 2 children under 5)

- 'Its so frustrating when patients come to me saying that they feel ill and they think they have COVID, but no note of when they started feeling ill! I wish they would bring me more information' (Jocelyn, 55, Nurse) 

- 'I feel terrible, but I dont know if its just a flu.. I want to know if my symtpoms are from COVID or something else. Im conscious of all the fear mongering and fake news out there..' (Luke, 28, Marketing manager)

Happy coding!
