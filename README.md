## Milestone 3 project

# Self isolation watch
'Self isolation watch' is designed to help people keep track of their symptoms and see what other users' symptoms are. They can add a symptom, description and the date they started feeling this way. 
This will help them keep note of their potential retraction of the virus as well as give them an indication into how contagious they are. Users will be able to create a profile, where they save their symptoms, update them accordingly and when they are no longer symptomatic, they can delete them.' 

## Main Aims 
- To create an app that gives people a platform to share their symtpoms and learn about each others.
- Take the pressure of a person to remember when they started feeling this way. 

## User Stories 
 
- 'As a recent self isolater, I want to keep track of what symtpoms I have and how long I have had them, so that I have more information to give to the doctor.'

- 'As a key worker, I want to browse through patients' symptoms, so that I can speed up diagnosis. '

- 'As a recent self isolater, I want to update the symptoms I have had, so that I can find out how far from recovery I am.'

- 'As a recent self isolater, I want to read through other peoples symptoms and compare, so that I can find out if my symptoms are typical.'


## Personnas 
- 'Someone at work has recently tested positive for covid-19, we must self isolate and track our symtoms (if any), I spend all day on my laptop, if only there was an app where i could record my symptoms and the date i started feeling the symptoms too!' (Evelyn, 31, mother of 2 children under 5)

- 'Its so frustrating when patients come to me saying that they feel ill and they think they have COVID, but no note of when they started feeling ill! I wish they would bring me more information' (Jocelyn, 55, Nurse) 

- 'I feel terrible, but I dont know if its just a flu.. I want to know if my symtpoms are from COVID or something else. Im conscious of all the fear mongering and fake news out there..' (Luke, 28, Marketing manager)

## UX design process

### Design Process

#### Design Process: UX Research 
Initially I had the idea to make an app which I would use in my career as a Personal Trainer, however, with the help of my wonderful [mentor]() I recognised that my emotional investment in the fruition of this project idea, was blocking my ability to see the importance of the functionality. It was also an idea, which required the user to already be aware of other such apps/ technology and was therefore not as accessible as the current idea I have ran with. 

I went for a COVID test and in the booking stages, I was being asked about what symptoms I have had to make me think that i may have contracted the virus. 

This triggered my idea, i thought that the average person, may not be able to accurately track when they started experiencing symptoms and unless faced with a format that asked you the right questions, the person may not recongise the severity of their symtpom. 

I used the easy to understand format of the [official gov- NHS site](https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test) and understood that user accessibilty was of the utmost importance. 

I knew that I wanted to create an app that would:
- releive the average person of the task of remebering what exactly their symtpoms were and when they developed. 
- provide a mechanism so that these symptoms could be updated/ deleted and created EASILY.
- ensure that my design would tell users that this site is for functional use, but also that this is a tool to hopefully serve for a goo outcome. 
- i was also adamant that i didnt want the site to be inundated with 'news' or 'information' forced upon the user. As we all know, the pandemic is a very emotional topic and causes unease for much of the population. 

I based my simplostic functional aspect of the app on the module-[mini-project-task-application]() expertly delivered by [code Institute]()


#### Design process: UX Design

1. Strategy plane: According to healthcare proffesionals, one of the biggest helps when having to diagnose a patient, is details on the patients symptoms. With the horrendous strain on our health care systems, i deduced that this app could be used as a tool to releive the workload of some of the hardworking front line staff that are in charge of diagnosing. 

2. Scope plane: After deciding on who this app was aimed toward and how it would be benefiting them, i started to think of the features i would need to use to make sure the app fit the needs of the users. The user would have to be able to:
- **C** reate their symptoms
- **R** ead and view the symptoms of others, as a reference point of the'r own and for future development, potentially interact with a user who has a symptom that this user recognises and wants to offer advice on. 
- **U** pdate their symptoms, again the tracking of the progression or regression of symtpoms will help significantly in the diagnosis process. 
- **D** elete their symptoms when they are no longer applicable.

I would input these key features into the design through the use of regsitration and login functionality, which would store the users information, allowing for the above tasks to be carried out effectively. 

I also wanted to provide a search bar, for users to search through the list of symptoms. In addition to this, i wanted to insure that i always had reinforcing messages/ prompts to let the user know what was happening, eg 'your symptom has been updated'.

3. Structure plane: I wanted to insure that the structure of this app was data centric. therefore i wanted to limit the pages. I would have a registration/ login page and a homepage. Once the user was logged in / registered, the pages they could naviagte between would be; add symptom, my_symptoms, home page and logout. I wanted this structure so that users would find this app easy to use and functional. Based on the subject matter, i figured that less is more, i was sure that if they were aware that it was important to track their symptoms, they would have been inundated with plenty of informsation regarding covid. i dint need to be another source. 

4. Skeleton plane: When deciding the above, i started to decipher the user experience up to this point. 
    1. The user would open the app, have a breif read of the limited content i have added for aesthetic and instructuonal puproses. 
    2. scroll down to see a list of ymptoms, (already added by other users), at this point they may choose that they wan to have a thorough read through these entries. Or search for a keyword, in the hopes that someone else has also experienced that same symptom. They couod do either, i would provide a search box for them to do so. The list will also be collapsible, showing only the headlines of the symptom entry; the symptom, the date they started experiencing the symtpom and who added it. If you click on it, then you will see the description of the symptom. I didnt want to make the isolation status of the person viewable, to anyone except the user whom the data is belonging to. Politically, whether people are chosing to self isolate, can be a huge source of contension and although a person could not be recognised from the username they have chosen, i wouldnt want the app to be the cause of any controversy moving forward. 
    3. as the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, they would see a footer, with a useful news link and the option to copy the site url, so that they can share it with others. 
    4. Once registered, they would be taken to the my symptoms page. and greeted with a welcome message including their username. Here they will see their current symtpoms and have the option to add new symptoms. 
    5. i wanted them to see how easy the process of adding and editing their symptoms are, with reinforcing messages such as 'your symtpom has been updated' and redirecting them to the list of their symptoms, viewable both on their profile (my symotoms tab) and the home page. 
    6. to make things faster, i wanted them to be able to edit/ delete on of their symptoms when viewing the list of symptoms on the homepoage and on their profiles. 
    7. after inputting their data/ simply reading their current data, they will log off and be told they have been logged off. 
    8. whilst logged off, they still have the opportunity to view the symptoms on the homepage, but juts not add to them. 

5. Surface plane: 
    * Due to the nature of the app strategy. I was concious that most images reflecting the topic could be triggereing to users. I decided early on that i would not use many pictures, the colours would be uplfiting but proffesional and I didnt want to lower the seriousness of the topic, with animations. 
    * Unlike my 2 previous Milestone Projects, I found it more effective to not have a logo, although there is defiently scope for this in the future. 
    * I used [coolors](https://coolors.co/), to create a coulor palette to work with, as shown below. I chose this palette as the colors were uplifting and warm yet formal, i felt this was the perfecct balance of feelings to be evoked in users when visiting my app. I wanted them to feel hopeful that they were going to be okay, soothed that this app and tool exists, but also aware of the importance of their data. 

    * I used Roboto and quicksand from Google Fonts, for the fonts used throughout my project. I saw the two fonts used together on a peers MS3 project and thought together the fonts were informative yet appraochable. 

    * I wanted to add a scroll-to-top button, which i had used in a previous project in this project as i felt it really added to smoot transition for the user. 

> Note: It was during the design process that i started to really develop my idea. I was sure to keep referring to my user stories to insure that i was meeting my criteria and my subsequent decisions made sense. 

### Design process

Selected color palette:
### Colour scheme
It was important to me that the seriousness of the topic wasnt distracted from and the site was still inviting and palatable. For this reason i decided on ![This colour scheme](/wireframes/Colour-scheme.png)

## Features

### Existing Features







# Bugs discovered

## - Password not encoding

* 

### solution:

## - Refresh causing null data input

* Everytime I was refreshing the page and logged in, a new input which was blank was being added to my mongo db. It was then also showing up on my page, as I was displaying all mongo.db entries. 

### solution:

## - Materialize 'carousel item' code not displaying 

* I had added some code from a meaterialize carousel and it wasnt showing up on my page.
* I tried to chnage the colour of the text and double checked that I wasnt pasting within any none relevant for loops etc. 
* I double checked that I had added the initialising JS code.
* I noticed that the carousel was not placed within a col, just a row. 

### solution:
1. After more scrutiny, I realised that the class for the carousel itel was actually set to '0'!
2. I rectified this with the following code in my styles.css file. 
```
.carousel {
    height: 400px !important;
}

```

- flash messages displaying with ``` [' '] ```

* I started trying to solve this issue by applying some css to the flash messages. This indeed made them more aesthetically pleasing, but did not solve the issue. 
* I then began to do some research which threw up plenty of alternative options for writing a conditional statement and for loop for my flash messages to sit within, but none helped me. 
* Finally, I found a thread in slack of someone experiencing the same issue! 


### solution:
1. I simply had to change the 'messages' object in the curly brackets to singular. I realised that i had initially made this mistake, because i was thinking of it as, all the flash messages must follow this format, but in reality, i only want one message at a time and EACH message must follow the same conditions. 
```
<div class="row">
{% with messages = get_flashed_messages() %}
    {% if messages %}
        {% for message in messages %}
            <div class="col s12 flashes">
                <h3 class="center-align">{{messages}}</h3>
            </div>
        {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}
{% endwith %}
</div>

```
```
<div class="row">
{% with messages = get_flashed_messages() %}
    {% if messages %}
        {% for message in messages %}
            <div class="col s12 flashes">
                <h3 class="center-align">{{message}}</h3>
            </div>
        {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}
{% endwith %}
</div>

```

### Deploying this project to Heroku 

To deploy the project to Heroku, I used the following steps:

1. I created a Heroku account, signed in and created a new app with a unique name that had not already been taken (this project uses ' '). I then set the region to the closest to me: 'Europe'.
2. With the app created, I went to the 'Settings' tab and clicked the 'Reveal Config Variables' button. From here, I input the following values:
```
MONGO_URI: mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster_name>-ocous.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
IP: 0.0.0.0
PORT: 5000
```
(Note: within the MONGO_URI value, I replaced the 'username','password', 'cluster_name' and 'database_name' with my specific database values. They are kept private for security reasons.)


3. In Gitpod, I created a requirements.txt file with the following command:
```
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```
4. I then created a Procfile with the following content within (making sure that 'Procfile' was written with a capitalized 'P'):
```
echo web: python app.py > Procfile
```
5. I then committed and pushed these new files with the following:
```
git add -A
```
```
git commit -m ""
```
```
git push
```
6. With these files committed and pushed, I navigated to the deployment tab on heroku.

7. I then clicked 'github' on the deployement method row.

8. When prompted, i typed the name of my git hub repo into the search box, ('self-isolation-watch') 

9. When my repo appeared I clicked it.

10. I then scrolled down towards the deploy button and clicked 'enable automatic deployment'.

11. finally i clicked deploy! 

12. to ensure that my app had successfully been deployed i clicked open app and saw the text 'hello world' which i had used as a test and returned within my first view in my app.py folder. 


This completed the process of deploying the project to Heroku. Once deployed, I continued to push all changes made to the project to Heroku throughout the remaining development process.
